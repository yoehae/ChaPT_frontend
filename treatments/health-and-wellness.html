                <p>Injury prevention is a core component of our wellness philosophy. Many common injuries result from weakness, poor flexibility, imbalance, or incorrect movement patterns. Our programs address these risk factors proactively. We identify areas of weakness or dysfunction, correct movement patterns, improve balance and stability, and build functional strength. By addressing these factors before an injury occurs, we help you maintain your health and independence and reduce your risk of injury significantly.</p>
