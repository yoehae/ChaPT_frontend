            <p>
              Postural restoration focuses on correcting asymmetries and imbalances in your body's alignment and movement patterns that contribute to pain and dysfunction. Body mechanics involves learning how to move your body safely and efficiently during daily activities to prevent injury and fatigue.

            <ul class="treatment-list">
              <li>Chronic back, neck, or shoulder pain</li>
              <li>Muscle imbalances and tightness</li>

              <li>Recurring joint pain or injury</li>
